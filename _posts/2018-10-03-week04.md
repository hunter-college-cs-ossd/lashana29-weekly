# Proofreading and Revising Our Peers' Posts

## Assignment 6

For this week's assignment, we had to work in groups and revise our peers' blog posts. It was interesting to do because we all had to work in a specific order to make sure we didn't end up with any merge conflicts. This assignment was a little frustrating because I ended up having a merge conflict with someone in my group. The person forked an older version of my repository before I had made some changes to it. I couldn't resolve it on GitHub or from the command line. I had to figure it out by looking at his fork of my repository and I realized it wasn't up to date with my repository. I had changed the name of a file and added a few new files. This definitely could've been less frustrating if I just used my brain and didn't change my repository until after the assignment was due. It took me too long to figure out what the issue was. I do feel like I have a better grasp and understanding of working with Git, though.

Additionally, it was nice to see how other people revised my posts. Revising the blogs of my group members reminded me of my time as an editor for my high school newspaper and my journalism class that I took in high school. I kind of enjoyed doing the revisions.
