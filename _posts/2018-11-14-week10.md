# Setting Up A Project
### Assignment 11

For this week's assignment, we had to set up the environment for the open source projects we chose to work on and we had to read two short articles:
1) [GitHub Flow](http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html) by Scott Chacon, which explains what GitHub flow is and in which situations the author prefers it over gitflow
2) [GitHub Flow Instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flow/), which details every step in GitHub flow

## Reading 1: GitHub Flow
It was interesting learn that there was more than one way to work using git. But, both GitHub flow and Gitflow are understandable. GitHub flow should be used for software that is frequently tested, updated and released quickly, whereas gitflow should be used for software with versions that are released much less quickly.

## Reading 2: GitHub Flow Instructions
This was also very straightforward and easy to understand.

## Setting Up Godot
The open source project my team is working on is [Godot](https://github.com/godotengine/godot). It's a game engine for 2D and 3D games. Finding the information I needed in order to [set up the environment](http://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.0/development/compiling/getting_source.html) wasn't hard at all. Neither was setting up the environment. My computer runs on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, so I followed [these instructions](http://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.0/development/compiling/compiling_for_x11.html) as well. But, I will say compiling and building took a long time. The process took an hour to an hour and a half. Everything seems to be working just fine as of right now. I also downloaded KDevelop (since my teammate Francis recommended it) and that was very straightforward as well. I followed [these instructions](http://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.0/development/cpp/configuring_an_ide.html#doc-configuring-an-ide-kdevelop) to use KDevelop to work on Godot.
