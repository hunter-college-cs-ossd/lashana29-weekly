# A Politician’s Misfortune
## Assignment 3

  This week, we were assigned the task of reacting to [this article](https://qz.com/1352568/running-for-office-is-hard-when-you-have-a-porn-stars-name-this-makes-it-worse/) about a Wikipedia contributor trying to publish a Wikipedia article about a female politician with the same name as a porn star. After reading the article, I am in support of Erica Herzog, the Wikipedia contributor who wrote an article for the politician Catalina Cruz and attempted to get the article published to the site. For a moment, let us forget about the fact that Herzog was considered "problematic" in the Wikipedia community, this issue comes down to ethics. A Colombian immigrant named Catalina Cruz is trying to run for office to make a difference, but has the misfortune of having the same name as a porn star. She came here as an undocumented immigrant and I am sure she has worked hard to get to this point in life. Allowing Catalina Cruz to have her own Wikipedia page would only help her campaign. Why not allow that woman to have a fighting chance? Wikipedia did not give her an article because according to their rules, she was not "notable". How could her Wikipedia article be denied when she had been mentioned in more than a few Spanish-language publications? Being mentioned in several publications should mean that a person is notable. Herzog also stated that she had worked on the Wikipedia pages for other politicians who were less "notable" than Cruz. 

  Cruz was not the only one who was treated unfairly by the Wikipedia community; Erica Herzog was also treated unfairly. As "problematic" as Herzog might have been, Cruz's article should have been allowed to be posted to the site. Herzog's actions have nothing to do with the content of her contributions. In the article, she was not labeled as problematic for making incorrect or obnoxious contributions. Herzog stated that she was globally banned without having been given a chance to "defend herself." I read about [Wikipedia's global banning policy](https://meta.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/WMF_Global_Ban_Policy) and the purpose of the ban is to 
> help improve the safety of Wikimedia community members, the movement itself, and the public in circumstances where actions on local community governance level are either insufficient or not possible.

  So Herzog may have been banned because she had exposed an editor's real name on the site, or she could have been banned because other members in the NYC Wikimedia chapter board categorized her behavior as "harassment." With an editor's real name out there, he/she can be located by someone in the Wikipedia community who wants to harm them. However, what does the community classify as harassment? From what the article states, Herzog's behavior was nothing close to harassment. It sounds as if she is just a woman who is not afraid to express her opinion in a community that is only 9% women. Herzog said the issue had to do with her "criticism of the local leadership and [the] Wikipedia community's gender bias." I would not be surprised if there were men who did not like Herzog's actions. Both the harassment claims and the exposure of an editor's real name made Herzog a target for a global ban because both made her look like a threat to the safety of other members of the community. So, globally banning Herzog was a fitting punishment (that is, if she actually was "harassing" anyone) and her efforts towards Catalina Cruz's Wikipedia article were ceased. Fortunately, Cruz won the primary election despite not having a Wikipedia article and I am happy about that. 

  But, I will say that Herzog's situation with Wikipedia has taught me that a lot goes into working with open source projects. Wikipedia has rules for the behavior of its members. Open source projects could have hundreds or thousands of contributions. What if someone made a contribution to an open source project, but it was nothing helpful in the slightest? What if a troll just decided to come along and mess something up? Having contributions go through an evaluation process or meet certain requirements before it officially apart of the project is important; it makes sure something helpful or something of quality is being added to the project. In the case of Wikipedia, it is very easy to post or contribute to an article on the site. But, it could get deleted by other editors later on if they decide it is not good enough or it is not worth having on the site. That is exactly why there is a long history of people who had made very incorrect but hilarious edits to Wikipedia articles.
