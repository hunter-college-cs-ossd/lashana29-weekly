# Git Workflow Assignment 
## Assignment 8

For this week, we were placed into groups of four or five and each individual was given a repository that contained a file we all needed to edit. When I was doing this assignment, I remembered the commands and all the steps I needed to take to get a copy of the repo on my local machine, make changes, and push those changes up to my fork of that repo. So, I’m starting to get the hang of using Git from the command line and creating pull requests, which is really good. Also, resolving merge conflicts was pretty easy to do. I didn’t really have trouble with anything for this assignment.
