## Godot

After not having much success with the other issue we were attempting to fix, we decided to begin looking for new ones that seemed easier. We decided to work on [this](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/23929) issue, in which someone changed the button shortcut to stop playing a scene from F8 to F9, but realized that their new key setting does not work while F8 still works when it’s not supposed to. Under the discussion on this thread, someone said that F8 is hard coded to stop playing a scene, so user settings don’t matter. I was trying to understand their code and figure out what everything did but, in the end, I couldn’t fix the issue. I also attempted to fix [this](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/24134) issue, but again, couldn’t fix anything. The smarter thing to do would have been to work on their documentation since reading their code is difficult. This is something I should’ve realized before I selected this project, and realize now that I should’ve been better at selecting a project I could contribute to.
