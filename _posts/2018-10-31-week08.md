# Finding An Open Source Project

At this time, I have no idea what project I'd like to contribute to. Can't seem to think of anything that would pique my interests. I don't want to spend my time working on something I don't actually care about. Eventually, something will come to me. For now, I'll keep searching for projects until I find something I like.
