# Navigating a Bug Tracker
## Assignment 9

For this assignment, we had to answer a series of questions about Bugzilla, Mozillaâ€™s bug tracker. The purpose of this assignment was to get us to navigate a bug tracker, become familiar with a bug tracker, and to see how easy or difficult it was to find specific information. Overall, this assignment was helpful. It familiarized me with a bug tracker.
