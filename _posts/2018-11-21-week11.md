# Bug Triage
## Assignment 12

For this assignment, we read a few articles about triaging bugs and were assigned the task of actually triaging some bugs from [launchpad.net](https://launchpad.net/). The list of bugs can be found [here](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/+bugs?field.searchtext=&search=Search+Bug+Reports&field.scope=all&field.scope.target=).

[Bug #1](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/kodi/+bug/1805417):

For this bug, I would change the importance to "Wishlist", since the user is not actually reporting a bug and is complaining about the logo for kodi.

[Bug #2](https://bugs.launchpad.net/aptdaemon/+bug/1805311):
For this bug, I would ask the user to specify the problem, provide reproduction instructions, and provide more information about their computer (e.g., what operating system they are using, what version of that operating system they are using, etc.).
