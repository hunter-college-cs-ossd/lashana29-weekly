### Assessing Welcomeness
1. Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues? Are responses generally constructive?

        The maintainers do respond helpfully. They tell contributors what they should change or add,
        or they may ask the contributor about their code. Generally, their tone is friendly and 
        not negative in any way.

2. Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat?

        Yes, people are friendly. People do not hesitate to mention a certain 
        maintainer to get their feedback specifically. If the maintainers weren't friendly,
        that wouldn't happen, and the contributor communication channels would be dead.

3. Do pull requests get reviewed?

        Yes, they do.

4. Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?

        Not always, but some do.
