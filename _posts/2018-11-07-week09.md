### Assessing Welcomeness
1. Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues? Are responses generally constructive?

        The maintainers do respond helpfully. They tell contributors what they should change or add,
        or they may ask the contributor about their code. Generally, their tone is friendly and 
        not negative in any way.

2. Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat?

        Yes, people are friendly. People do not hesitate to mention a certain 
        maintainer to get their feedback specifically. If the maintainers weren't friendly,
        that wouldn't happen, and the contributor communication channels would be dead.

3. Do pull requests get reviewed?

        Yes, they do.

4. Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?

        Not always, but some do.

## Project 2: LibreOffice
This repository is read-only, so no one is allowed to make pull requests (and have it get merged) on here. The maintainers use [Gerrit](https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/#/q/status:open) for development. This repository simply mirrors what is on Gerrit.


### First Questions
1. How many lines of code does LibreOffice have?

        9,284,387 lines of code.

2. What percentage of the code is comments?

        12.2%.

3. How many commits were made in the last 30 days, based on OpenHub statistics?

        1,177 commits.

4. Click on "User & Contributor Locations" (lower right side of screen). List some of the locations of the developers.

        The map would not show any developer locations.

### Project License
1. What is the project's license?

        GNU General Public License.

### Assessing Activity
#### *Commits*
1. When was the last commit?

        October 30th, 2018.

2. How many contributors does the project have?

        825.

3. How often do people commit?

        Pretty much every day.

#### *Issues*
In my search for a bug tracker for LibreOffice, I found [this page](https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/QA/BugReport), which states that not all bugs for LibreOffice should be posted on Bugzilla. But, I believe for general LibreOffice bugs, they can be reported on Bugzilla. The page also details how to submit a bug on Bugzilla. Their work on Gerrit seems to show only their pull requests on there and GitHub. So, I am not quite sure what issue tracker to use for LibreOffice. I guess Iâ€™ll use the Bugzilla issue tracker.

        14,242.

        where to open his pull request.

        No. This repository is read-only, so no contributions are allowed.
